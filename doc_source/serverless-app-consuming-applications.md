Following, you can find out how to find and deploy serverless applications that have been published to the AWS Serverless Application Repository\. You can browse for applications that are publicly available without having an AWS account by visiting the [public site](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo)\. Alternatively, you can browse for applications from within the AWS Lambda console\.

1. Choose an application to view details such as its capabilities and the number of times it has been deployed by AWS customers\. \(Note: The deployment counts are shown for the region in which you are trying to deployment application\)

1. On the application detail page, you can view the application's permissions, application resources via the SAM template, license, and readme file\. You can also find the **Source code URL** link for applications that are publicly shared\.

1. On the **Deployment status** page you can view the progress of your deployment\. While waiting for your deployment to complete, you can search and browse for other applications, and return to this page through the Lambda console\.
