The AWS Serverless ApplicationRepository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud\. For more information about serverless applications, see [Serverless Computing and Applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless) on the AWS website\.

The AWS Serverless ApplicationRepository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console\. So as a developer, you don’t need to learn anything new\. You can browse for applications by using category keywords, such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots\. You can easily search for applications by name, publisher, or event source\. To use an application, you simply choose it, configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks\.

You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately within your team or across your organizations\. To publish a serverless application \(or app\), you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), or AWS SDKs to upload the code\. Along with the code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model \(AWS SAM\) template\. For more information about AWS SAM, see [AWS Serverless Application Model \(AWS SAM\)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model)\.

In this guide, you can find out about the two developer experiences available through the AWS Serverless Repository: 

+ [Consuming Applications \(Preview\)](serverless-app-consuming-applications.md) – Browse for applications and view information about them, including source code and readme files\. Also install, configure, and launch applications of your choosing\.

+ [Publishing Applications \(Preview\)](serverless-app-publishing-applications.md) – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other developers, and publish new versions of applications\.
